# SpringBootCQRS
This Repository is used to implimentation of CQRS design pattern of microservices. i.e. How we can use the Master DB for write operation and Slave/Read-Replica DB for read operation. In K8S world where we can deploy multiple replica for scaling then we need to handle in code, so that all read queries will be executed in Readreplica or slave DB and CUD query executed in Master DB.  
**Assumption**:- Master-Slave or Master-ReadReplica DB are in sync i.e whenever there is some command( CUD ) operation executed in master DB then that changes is available in Slave or ReadReplica DB to execte read operation.
